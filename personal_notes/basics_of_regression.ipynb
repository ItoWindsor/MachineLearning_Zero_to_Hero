    "**Supervised learning** is a class of problem in Machine Learning where the output/dependent variables/response/target variable is known and the target variable is a quantitative measurement. Our goal on this problem is to infer or predict as good as we can the dependant variable through some inputs/predictors/independent variables. In fact this task can be viewed as a **function approximation**       \n",
