This depository is here as a follow-up of my journey in machine learning to go from Zero to Hero. Here you shall find in each folders : 
- datasets 
  - Here you should find all datasets used during the journey
- projects 
  - Here you should find all the code related to the work on the datasets. They are mostly found on kaggle or UCL. The file "Preliminary_choosing_datasets" deals with how and why such datasets have been chosen. 
- personal notes 
  - Here you should find all my personal notes. They deal with the models, the algorithms, how they work, their pros and cons.
